About "Rhythmic Authentication System":

The purpose of this project was to develop a more demanding password system than the universal standard (key/symbol) while attempting to maintain a similar level of usability. The program can interpret simultaneous key strokes (increasing the variety of a single key input greatly - by nine fingers at least). Moreover, the program records the duration of each key stroke, and the duration between key strokes. Essentially, the password system is a melody (key inputs) with a distinct rhythm (duration of inputs and pauses). The passwords are recorded in a database and when a user is signing in, the password is verified in "real time" - each duration and key input is checked separately.
